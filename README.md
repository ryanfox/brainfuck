A simple Brainfuck interpreter implemented in python.
[See the wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) for more information about the language.

It's not performant or optimized in any way, but it works.  Maybe I'll improve it if I feel like it.

Usage: `python brainfuck.py <your_brainfuck_file.b>`
